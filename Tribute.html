    <p>Timeline of Nikola Tesla's life</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1853</strong> - Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia). </li>
        <li><strong>1861</strong> - Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.</li>
        <li><strong>1875</strong> - Tesla enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz on a Military Frontier scholarship</li>
        <li><strong>1878</strong> - Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of college</li>
        <li><strong>1881</strong> - Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange</li>
        <li><strong>1882</strong> - Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company, . There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. </li>
        <li><strong>1884</strong> - In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well.[44] In June 1884, Tesla emigrated
        <li><strong>1886</strong> - Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain</li>
        <li><strong>1887</strong> - Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission 
        <li><strong>1888</strong> - Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor.
        <li><strong>1891</strong> - Aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.
        <li><strong>1896</strong> - After hearing of Röntgen's discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography), Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil      
        <li><strong>1937</strong> - Tesla received the Order of the White Lion from the Czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslav ambassador.[218] On questions concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, "But it is not an experiment ... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world."</li>    
        <li><strong>1943</strong> - At the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not disturb" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis.</li>
